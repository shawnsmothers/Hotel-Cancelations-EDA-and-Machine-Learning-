# Hotel-Cancelations-EDA-and-Machine-Learning-
EDA using python and Logistic Regression to predict cancelations  


<p>In my recent project, I developed a comprehensive model to predict hotel booking cancellations. The primary goal was to identify the factors that most significantly impact cancellation rates and to provide actionable insights for hotel management.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>To achieve this, I began by collecting and preprocessing a dataset that included various features such as lead time, deposit type, customer segment, previous cancellations, and special requests. I performed extensive data cleaning and feature engineering to ensure the dataset was suitable for modeling. This included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.</p>

<h2>Data Analysis and Visualization</h2>
<p>Using Python and libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover initial patterns and correlations. Visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn helped to illustrate these findings. For instance, it became evident that longer lead times and non-refundable deposits were strongly correlated with higher cancellation rates.</p>

<h2>Model Development</h2>
<p>I then trained several machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to predict cancellations. After evaluating their performance, the logistic regression model emerged as the most effective, achieving an accuracy of 85%. Cross-validation was used to ensure the model's robustness and to prevent overfitting.</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>The final model revealed that longer lead times and non-refundable deposits significantly increase the likelihood of cancellations. Other factors, such as customer segment and previous cancellations, also played important roles.</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>These insights can help hotels implement targeted strategies to reduce cancellations, such as offering flexible booking options, optimizing deposit policies, and focusing on customer segments with higher cancellation risks. By applying these strategies, hotels can improve booking efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase revenue.</p>
